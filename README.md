## üìò Overview

This notebook explores how clustering algorithms, particularly K-means, can be applied to scaled cryptocurrency market data. It further reduces dimensionality using PCA and re-applies clustering to evaluate performance. The project demonstrates:

- Scaling and preprocessing numeric features
- Elbow method for optimal `k` selection
- Clustering with K-means
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA
- Visualization of cluster outputs
